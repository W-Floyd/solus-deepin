# Solus Deepin

## I'm a dragon, hear me roar!

### It *IS* broken, and will remain so.

A collection of packages meant for getting Deepin running on Solus. Almost entirely lifted from the Arch repo.

Put together over a week or so, trying to learn a bit and fill time. I don't see myself seeing this to any level of completion, I'm surprised I got as far as I did.

*Update* - I tried poking at this some more, but Arch is lagging upstream and I can't be bothered to work on this too much. The effort of attempting to build *and update* and desktop stack at the same time is beyond me. Maybe someday...
