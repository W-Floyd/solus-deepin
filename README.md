# Solus Deepin

## I'm a dragon, hear me roar!

### It *IS* broken, and will remain so.

This is an exercise in packaging Deepin.
It is not ready - nor intended - for actual use, and it *will not* go into the Solus repos.

***

A collection of packages meant for getting Deepin running on Solus. Almost entirely lifted from the Arch repo.

Put together over a week or so, trying to learn a bit and fill time. I don't see myself seeing this to any level of completion, I'm surprised I got as far as I did.

*Update 4* - I've been working through, trying to get a functioning desktop. Takes a while though...

*Update 3* - I've sorta gotten past the point of needing to watch the Arch repos, so maybe I'll do more here?
Thinking I'll be ironing things out, package by package (i.e. Terminal and all deps, file manager and all deps, etc.)
Ideally, I will keep rundeps to a minumum, since someone might only want one app.

*Update 2* - I poked some more, got past some issues, still stuck on some things.

*Update* - I tried poking at this some more, but Arch is lagging upstream and I can't be bothered to work on this too much. The effort of attempting to build *and update* and desktop stack at the same time is beyond me. Maybe someday...
